# Disney-Movies-and-Box-Office-Success

Since the 1930s, Walt Disney Studios has released more than 600 films covering a wide range of genres. While some movies are indeed directed towards kids, many are intended for a broad audience. In this project, you will analyze data to see how Disney movies have changed in popularity since its first movie release.

For implementing this project, following python functionalities were used:-

1. `Seaborn`. To Visualize the Genre Popularity trend

2. `Pandas`. For data-manipulation and reading the CSV data-set

3. `Numpy`. For maintaining the data-set
